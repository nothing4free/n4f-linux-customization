# n4f-linux-customization
I often find myself constantly switching between Linux VM's and hosts. This is a place where I'll upload all my ZSH aliases, config files and more, so I can easily switch between machines and get everything up and running the way I like it fast.

## What shell do I use?
I like to run **ZSH** with **oh-my-zsh** and [**Powerlevel10K**](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k). 

## Cool CLI tools / commands I use
### lsd: a colored, better ls command.
Available here: [https://github.com/Peltoche/lsd](https://github.com/Peltoche/lsd). **Check the repo's readme for package manager installation options!**

### Batcat: a better cat command.
``` sudo apt install batcat ``` or ```sudo pacman -S install bat```
